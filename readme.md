# JS Learning Journey

A personal repository of casual practice projects while learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This is not a portfolio. Just raw code, tests, and ideas as I learn and experiment.

## Structure

### /frontend-experiments
Basic static UI mockups built with HTML and CSS.

- `resume-clone`: Simple personal resume layout
- `login-ui`: Login screen UI demo

### /js-projects
Small JavaScript-based projects to practice logic, DOM, and interactivity.

- `dice-game`
- `number-guess-game`
- `random-number-gen`
- `password-generator`
- `temp-converter`
- `student-db`: Object + array data tests

## Notes

Some folders may be incomplete or messy ... this repo is part of my ongoing learning process.
