# JS Learning Journey

A personal repository of casual practice projects while learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This is not a portfolio. Just raw code, tests, and ideas as I learn and experiment.

## Structure

### /frontend-experiments
Basic static UI mockups built with HTML and CSS.


### /js-projects
Small JavaScript-based projects to practice logic, DOM, and interactivity.


## Notes

Some folders may be incomplete or messy ... this repo is part of my ongoing learning process.
